This project is designed to simulate a malware-ridden website and recreate some of the tricks these types of sites use to torment users and/or manipulate them into downloading unintended programs. The website will be modeled to look like a popular flash game website, offering links to several different games to play. Each link will lead to a page that simulates a different type of malicious behavior common to many shady websites. Some of these may include:

-Popup that reappears at different locations on the page when the user attempts to close it
-Page full of misleading download links designed to confuse the user into downloading an unintended file/program
-Page that forces the browser into fullscreen mode against the user's will

All group members will contribute to the design of the basic webpage layout. Implementation of the seperate features outlined above will be divided between members, with 1-2 assigned to each.
