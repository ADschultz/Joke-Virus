This project is designed to simulate a malware-ridden website and recreate some of the tricks these types of sites use to torment users and/or manipulate them into downloading unintended programs. The website will be modeled to look like a popular flash game website, offering links to several different games to play. Each link will lead to a page that simulates a different type of malicious behavior common to many shady websites. Some of these may include:

- Popup that reappears at different locations on the page when the user attempts to close it
- Page full of misleading download links designed to confuse the user into downloading an unintended file/program
- Page that forces the browser into fullscreen mode against the user's will

All group members will contribute to the design of the basic webpage layout. Implementation of the seperate features outlined above will be divided between members, with 1-2 assigned to each.

The members of this group are:
Aaron SchultzII 
Emily Seal 
Jacob Iwaniec 
Michael Kling
Richard Sekol
Ryan Stuk

Project Submission one contributions:

Emily- Added a scroll bar, took out the duplicate boxes for the genres, added some background colors, changed the font of the title and the actual title itself, added a little blurb underneath title

Jacob Iwaniec - For my page, I was going to have a a game advertised to download at the top of the page, then below it like 15 different different download buttons. Some will have pop ups that say "not this one" or "try again". Some will just be picture
